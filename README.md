### Game instructions:
-------------------------

The game has 4 difficulties, the cards are shuffled from the deck of cards and acoording to the difficulty level (1, 2, 3, 4) are delivered 4, 6, 8 or 10 cards.

The player must place the cards in ascending order from least to greatest according the year. For each card in correct order, the player earns 10 points.

You win each level of the game when you put all the cards in correct order.

Click on the card you want to put on the board, if it's in the correct place it'll has a green border and if it's wrong will has a red border. You can click again on the wrong card, but you will lose a live( you only have 3).
